## Technologies Used 

### React.js

React.js is a JavaScript library that allows you to build fast and efficient web applications using the minimum amount of code possible. In React.js, you can break the web layout into components - reusable bits of code that return HTML elements.

### Chakra UI Library 

Chakra UI is a library that allows you to build stunning and modern web applications using various layout components. It differs from other UI frameworks in that it offers accessibility and dark mode support by default. 

With Chakra UI, you spend less time building responsive and beautiful websites. If you want to create a web application that allows users to switch between different color modes with minimal lines of code, then Chakra UI is an excellent choice.
